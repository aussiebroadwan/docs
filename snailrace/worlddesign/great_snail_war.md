# The Great Snail War

The Great Snail War was a pivotal conflict that shaped the history of the world. 
It occured before the establishment of the World Snailrace Series (WSRS) and 
marked a period of strife and division among the three prominent nations. The 
reason it was the Great Snail War was also due to snails being used in warefare. 
Each snail being masters of their respected snail species, employed them in 
various strategic purposes.

The origins of the Great Snail War can be traced back to a complex web of 
political tensions, territorial disputes, and the desire to gain a competitive 
edge through snail-related advancements. Each of the three nations had its 
reasons for entering the war:


1. **Stormherald Dominion (Kasaihara)**: 

	The Stormherald Dominion sought to expand its territory into the 
    resource-rich lands of Verkstadheim. Kasaihara sought to exploit their 
    advanced mystical sealing magic as an advantage.

	Kasaihara utilised Stormstrike snails to generate devastating storms and 
    heatwaves that scorched enemy territories. While also using Terraforge 
    snails to construct seals and barriers to protect their lands.


2. **InfernalForge Realm (Verkstadheim)**: 

	Fueled by the quest for technological dominance, Verkstadheim pursued 
    aggressive expansionism to aquire Kasaihara's expertise in agricultural 
    advancements and to learn about this mystical sealing magic they believe 
    to be myth.

	Verkstadheim leveraged their newly made bioengineered Circuitshells for 
    reconnaissance, communication, and transportation. These snails carried 
    messages and supplies across the battlefield with unparalleled speed. 


3. **Frostbound Summit (Yukiyama)**: 

	Yukiyama, acting in secrecy and influenced by the elder Obsidianshells, 
    embarked on a shadowy campaign. While the other two nations were locked 
    in warfare, Yukiwama infiltrated and manipulated both from within. They 
    sowed internal discord, acted as assassins, and manipulated events to tear 
    apart Kasaihara and Verkstadeheim, all while remaining hidden in the 
    shadows.

	Yukiyama used their influence over the Obsidianshells to manipuate the 
    powers of darkness. They sent Obsidianshells into the heart of enemy 
    territories, creating chaos and fear by disrupting communications, 
    sabotaging supply lines and assassinating key figures.

The political landscape was greatly changed over the course of the war. With 
Alliances and rivalries being made and destroyed. After the first 5 years, the 
Stormherald Dominion and InfernalForge Realm formed a temporary alliance to 
counter the Frostbound Summits treachery and worked together to build immunities 
against the Obsidianshells. After the 8 years of prolonged usage and contact 
with the Elder Obsidianshells along with using lesser Obsidianshells, the minds 
of the Yukiyama leader's plunged into insanity causing internal conflucts and 
betrayals, weakening their position in the war. The conflict evolved into a 
multi-front battle, with engagements in diverse landscapes and terrains.

The Great Snail War persisted for several generations, inflicting widespread 
devastation and suffering across the contient. The conflict was characterised 
by numerous battles, shifting allegiances, and innovative applications of snail 
abilities.

Ultimately, the war concluded due to a collective yearning for peace, unity and 
knowledge-sharing. Leaders from all three nations recognised the futility of 
the ongoing conflict and decided to harness the unique abilities of their 
snails for a common goal. This pivotal moment marked the birth of the World 
Snailrace Series (WSRS), symbolising unity, collabaration and shared progress.

In the 64th year of peace, the WSRS continues to stand as a testament to the 
desire for harmony and strength of cooperation among nations that were once 
embroiled in conflict.
