# Frostglacier Chillshell

The Frostglacier Chillshell is an extraordinary snail breed that thrives in the frigid realms of ice and snow. Its shell is composed of shimmering, translucent ice crystals that reflect the polar beauty of the frozen landscapes. The snail's body is agile and built for cold climates, allowing it to glide effortlessly across icy terrain.

The lore of the Frostglacier Chillshell snails is steeped in the tales of ancient ice shamans. Legend has it that these remarkable snails were once the companions of the Frost Shamans, mystics who communed with the spirits of the ice. The Chillshells were believed to possess the essence of the Arctic Frost Serpent, a powerful ice spirit that ruled the polar regions. It is said that the snails' ice crystal shells were bestowed upon them by the Frost Serpent as a symbol of its protection and favour. The Frostglacier Chillshells served as guides to travellers navigating the treacherous ice realms, their glacial trails illuminating the path through the frozen wilderness. In the world of snail racing, these creatures symbolise the indomitable spirit of ice and the bond between mortals and the mystical ice spirits.

- **Frozen Glide**: Sliding gracefully on icy terrain, the snail conserves Stamina and boosts its Agility (`+2`).
- **Glacial Resilience**: Tapping into glacial resilience, the snail improves its Endurance (`+3`).
- **Frosty Aura**: Emitting a chilling aura, the snail temporarily reduces the Speed (`-2`) and Agility (`-1`) of opponents in its vicinity.
- **Glacial Freeze**: Freezes the snail's shell with an icy blast, significantly reducing opponents' Speed (`-3`) and Agility (`-2`) while also decreasing the snail's Stamina (`-1`).
- **Avalanche Rush**: Summons an avalanche of ice and snow, creating difficult terrain for opponents and causing a Speed (`-3`) reduction while providing the snail an Agility (`+3`) boost.
