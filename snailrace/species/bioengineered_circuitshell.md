The history of the Bioengineered Circuitshell snails is a tale of innovation and scientific achievement. Created by the visionary technomages of the ancient Technomage Guild, these snails represent a revolutionary leap in snail racing. Faced with the limitations of natural evolution, the technomages embarked on a daring experiment to create a breed that would surpass the boundaries of natural capabilities. Through their relentless pursuit of knowledge, they combined organic matter with advanced technology, resulting in the birth of the Circuitshells. These artificial wonders quickly made a name for themselves in the racing circuit, their unmatched speed and stamina capturing the attention of enthusiasts and researchers alike. The Bioengineered Circuitshells have become living testaments to the boundless possibilities of science and its impact on the world of snail racing.

::: info Abilities
- **Technomagical Enhancement**: Upgrading through technomagical enhancements, the snail improves its Speed (`+2`) and Stamina (`+1`).
- **Cyber Dash**: Activating thrusters for a burst of incredible Speed, the snail accelerates with cybernetic precision, gaining increased Speed (`+3`).
- **Nano-Repair Matrix**: Deploying a nano-repair matrix, the snail boosts its Stamina (`+2`) and rapidly recovers health.
- **Overclocked Surge**: Pushing the limits with an overclocked surge, the snail temporarily increases its Speed (`+2`) and Agility (`+2`) to extraordinary levels.
- **Cybernetic Overdrive**: Activates a temporary overdrive mode, greatly boosting the snail's Speed (`+4`) but causing a slight decrease in Endurance (`-1`).
- **Technomagnetic Disruption**: Emits disruptive technomagnetic waves, temporarily disabling opponent abilities giving the snail improved Endurance (`+2`) and Agility (`+2`)
