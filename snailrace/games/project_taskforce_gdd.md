## Story

The world of snail racing is a vibrant, competitive, and sometimes dark world, 
where remarkable snails and their racers compete for glory and fame. While the 
legal snail racing circuit is governed by the International Snail Racing 
Federation (ISRF) and its rules and regulations, there exists a hidden realm of 
snail racing that defies all norms, ethics, and legality. This is the 
underground snail racing scene, often referred to as the "Dark Underbelly", 
where anything goes and competitors are willing to push snail modifications 
to the brink in the relentless pursuit of victory.

The underground snail racing scene poses a threat to the integrity and the 
welfare of snail racing, as it exposes the unethical and illegal practices that
some racers and teams engage in. It also creates a demand for a black market 
for snails and snail-related products, fueling the dangerous subculture of 
snail racing. In response to the growing menace of the underground snail racing 
scene, a dedicated police task force has been formed to counteract the illegal 
events and safeguard the welfare of snails and participants.

The player plays as a snail agent who works for the police task force. The 
player has to infiltrate and dismantle the illegal snail racing rings, while 
avoiding detection and harm. The player can also manage their squad of snails 
and humans, build equipment, make upgrades, and setup research. The player can 
choose from different types of missions, such as spy, sabotage, eliminate, or 
rescue, and each mission can have different parameters, such as location, 
time, weather, and difficulty. The player can also encounter random events and 
surprises, such as ambushes, traps, or allies, that can affect the outcome of 
the mission.

The player's actions and decisions during the missions can have positive or 
negative impacts on the game world and the story. For example, the player can 
gain or lose reputation, allies, or enemies, or change the state of the world 
and the underground snail racing scene. The player can also face moral dilemmas 
and ethical questions, such as whether to spare or kill an enemy, or whether 
to rescue or abandon a snail, that can affect their character and their squad.

The game features multiple endings and branching paths, depending on the
player's choices and actions throughout the game. The game also features a 
dynamic and unpredictable gameplay experience, where the player has to adapt 
and improvise to the changing situations. The game aims to create a thrilling 
and immersive story, where the player has to face the consequences and the 
risks of their actions and decisions.

### Gameplay Loop

The gameplay loop of the game is as follows:

- The player starts the game by creating their character and choosing their 
  snail breed and their human profession.

- The player is introduced to their squad and their base of operations, where 
  they can access various options and features to manage their squad and 
  prepare for the missions.

- The player is given their first mission by one of the higher ups, who 
  communicates with them through a mission select screen. The player can 
  choose from three different random missions, each with its own title, 
  description, type, and reward. The player chooses the mission and prepares 
  their squad for the mission.

- The player and their squad arrive at the mission location, which is a 
  procedurally generated level. The player has to navigate the level and 
  complete the mission objectives, while avoiding detection and harm. The 
  player can use their snail and human abilities, as well as their items and 
  gadgets, to overcome the challenges and enemies. The player can also 
  encounter random events and surprises, such as ambushes, allies, or twists, 
  that can affect the outcome of the mission.

- The player completes the mission and returns to their base of operations. 
  The player receives the reward for the mission, as well as some resources 
  and items that they found or acquired during the mission. The player can use 
  these resources and items to improve their squad and their equipment. The 
  player can also see the consequences and the impacts of their actions and 
  decisions during the mission, such as gaining or losing reputation, allies, 
  or enemies, or changing the state of the world and the underground snail 
  racing scene. The player can also face moral dilemmas and ethical questions, 
  such as whether to spare or kill an enemy, or whether to rescue or abandon 
  a snail, that can affect their character and their squad.

- The player can then choose to continue with the next mission, or to explore 
  their base of operations and interact with their squad. The game continues 
  with a cycle of missions, base management, and character development, until 
  the player reaches the end of the game. The game features multiple endings 
  and branching paths, depending on the player's choices and actions 
  throughout the game.

## Missions

Missions are the core gameplay element of the game, where the player and their 
squad have to infiltrate and dismantle the illegal snail racing rings, while 
avoiding detection and harm. The player can choose from different types of 
missions, each with its own objectives, challenges, and rewards. The player 
can also encounter random events and surprises, such as ambushes, allies, or 
twists, that can affect the outcome of the mission.

The missions are procedurally generated, meaning that the level layout, the 
enemy placement, the item distribution, and the event occurrence are randomly 
determined each time the player starts a mission. This creates a dynamic and 
unpredictable gameplay experience, where the player has to adapt and 
improvise to the changing situations.

The missions are also permadeath, meaning that if the player or any of their 
squad members die during a mission, they are permanently lost and cannot be 
revived or replaced. This creates a high-stakes and challenging gameplay 
experience, where the player has to be careful and strategic with their 
actions and decisions.

The missions are also consequential, meaning that the player's actions and 
decisions during a mission can have positive or negative impacts on the game 
world and the story. For example, the player can gain or lose reputation, 
allies, or enemies, or change the state of the world and the underground snail 
racing scene. The player can also face moral dilemmas and ethical questions, 
such as whether to spare or kill an enemy, or whether to rescue or abandon a 
snail, that can affect their character and their squad.

The game features the following types of missions:

- **Spy**: 
        Spy missions require the player and their squad to be stealthy, to 
        break into control rooms and vaults, and to gather intelligence. If 
        any squad member is seen by an enemy, they must eliminate them before 
        they alert or set off the alarm. Spy missions reward the player with 
        credits, items, and information.

- **Rescue**: 
        Rescue missions require the player and their squad to stage a heist 
        into the level and rescue the snails or humans that are being 
        illegally experimented on or held captive. The player is authorized 
        to take out anyone who gets in the way. Rescue missions reward the 
        player with credits, items, and new squad members.

- **Sabotage**: 
        Sabotage missions require the player and their squad to break into the 
        level and stealthily sabotage documents or lab equipment, or to plant 
        explosives or viruses. This must be done with minimal to no 
        casualties. Sabotage missions reward the player with credits, items, 
        and research.

- **Survival and Distraction**: 
        Survival and Distraction missions require the player and their squad 
        to make as much noise as possible and to draw the enemies to them. 
        They must survive for a set number of turns before they are able to 
        extract or flee from the level. In the story, this mission is used 
        to allow an unknown party of the task force to infiltrate and get 
        hidden information, requiring the enemy's attention to be drawn away 
        from them. The player can choose to stay longer than the initial set 
        turns to get more rewards, though the risk of full squad wipeout is 
        higher. Survival and Distraction missions reward the player with 
        credits, items, and reputation.

- **Capture**: 
        Capture missions require the player and their squad to capture a VIP 
        enemy and subdue them and bring them back into custody. The player 
        has to avoid killing the target and to protect them from harm. 
        Capture missions reward the player with credits, items, and 
        interrogation.

- **Elimination**: 
        Elimination missions require the player and their squad to eliminate 
        a VIP enemy or a group of enemies. The player has to locate and kill 
        the target or targets, while avoiding collateral damage. Elimination 
        missions are frowned upon by the task force, but are sometimes 
        necessary to shut down a notorious operation. Elimination missions 
        reward the player with credits, items, and reputation.
