# Welcome to the TAB

The TAB, short for The Aussie BroadWAN, represents a close-knit community of 
developers who enjoy creating small applications for both leisure and social 
interaction. Within the TAB Discord server, you'll find a diverse range of 
channels designed for sharing resources, discussing tech news, rating beverages, 
and providing assistance with development projects.
